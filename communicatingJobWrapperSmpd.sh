# PARALLEL_SERVER_MATLAB_EXE  - the MATLAB executable to use
# PARALLEL_SERVER_MATLAB_ARGS - the MATLAB args to use

# PARALLEL_SERVER_DECODE_FUNCTION     - the decode function to use
# PARALLEL_SERVER_STORAGE_LOCATION    - used by decode function
# PARALLEL_SERVER_STORAGE_CONSTRUCTOR - used by decode function
# PARALLEL_SERVER_JOB_LOCATION        - used by decode function
